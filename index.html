                      The algorithm is specially designed to make sure that in each group there is at least one perfect match. A perfect match is one, where a persons preference has them as well on their preference list, on the same level or higher. <br><br>After that the algorithm will try to find someone who is matching the best with the person in the group. However if no person who can be matched is found then a random person is added. But it is important to remember, that in each group there is at least one perfect match which means that it is possible that some input's are impossible to resolve. <br><br>The score provided at the end is a ratio of the number of good matches made, to the number of bad matches made. Good matches are those which both people have themselves in their preference list, and bad matches are those which the match has been made randomly. These matches, are only the ones that the algorithm compared, which means that there could be more in the groups. The higher the score the better the matches were, and the lower the worst. A score of 1 is considered average.

                          The algorithm used in this program, is a variation o the Gale-Shapley Algorithm, also known as the stable-marriage algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to match teams based on preference list provided by each person. It will match people who want to be together, rather than people who don't want to be together. The Gale-Shaple algorithm has previously won a nobel prize for its potential use in the real world.<br><br> Currently the algorithm is being used for medical interns, which are applying to hospitals and research facilities for internships. However this can be used also has a way to create sleeping arrangments for a trip, or team arrangments for a certain sport. The use of this program is astoningly wide.

                <p class="card-text">Welcome to <b>MatchAlg</b>, where we create the ideal groups for you! <br>All you have to do is upload a .csv file with everybodies names and preference lists, as well as the number of groups you want, and our algorithm will do the rest for you.<br>The .csv file has to be properly formatted for this to work, so please make sure you follow the steps bellow:<br> 1. The first line of your file has to be one number, which determines the amount of groups you would like in the end. <br> 2. The second line of the code is the names (or ID's), of everyone seperated by commas. Make sure there is no comma at the end, and spaces don't matter. This is how the algorithm will output all the groups. <br> 3. Every line after that is the preference list of everyone, in order in which you provided in line 2. So if the first person you provided in line 2, was John, then line 3 is John's preference list. If Mark is the second person provided, then line 4, is Mark's preference list and so on. Make sure that everyone is seperated by commas just like in line 2. <br> <br> Note: if your input is coming from a csv file managed by a spreadsheet application, than every value in each box is seperated by commas, so you won't have to insert the commas yourself. Here is an <button data-toggle="modal" data-target="#csvexample">example</button> text csv file, and here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ST3QAnMvOJYSbH17escuvw9MxSmAV-IW/view" target="_blank">link </a> to an example csv spreadsheet file.</p>
